    As a woman, many a times you might have wondered why 
    does our human body have to shed blood, have to go through a giant amount of sheer pain and stress and mood changes every month? What is happening in our human body that leads to a monthly shedding of blood? And what measures should you, as a woman take when you encounter this situation? To get the answer for all these questions, we would need to know about the women reproductive system.

  <p  class="reproductive_system">
<h1>THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM</h1>
    The human body is one of the most complex, highly organized structure, made up of unique cells which work together to accomplish the specific functions necessary for sustaining life. A group of cells make up tissue, a group of tissues make up organs and a group of organs make up an organ system. Different organ systems in the human body work together and make the human body capable of functioning. One such organ system in the human body is the reproductive system. 
Before moving ahead, one should know What is Reproduction? Reproduction is the process by which organisms make more organisms like themselves. It is an essential process that has kept a variety of species alive. Different organisms reproduce differently. Some organisms, like amoeba, reproduce by dividing and multiplying themselves (Asexual Reproduction). While other organisms, like animals, reproduce through mating, in which a male gamete and a female gamete fuse together to form a new individual (Sexual Reproduction).

        <h1>THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM</h1>
        <h1>The Female Anatomy</h1>
        The female reproductive anatomy includes part inside and outside the body. 
        The function of the external female reproductive structures is twofold: to enable the sperm to enter the body and to protect the internal genital organs from infectious organisms. While the function of the internal reproductive system is responsible for the fertilization, gestation, and development of the fetus. Reproduction organs also produce sex hormones that start and maintain sexual development during puberty. 
The internal reproductive system is also responsible for menstruation and the menstrual cycle. The internal reproductive organs in the female include:
<br>
•	Vagina: The vagina is a canal that joins the cervix (the lower part of the uterus) to the outside of the body. It is also known as the birth canal.
<br>
•	Uterus (womb): The uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ that is the home to a developing fetus. The uterus is divided into two parts: the cervix, which is the lower part which opens into the vagina, and the main body of the uterus, called the corpus. The corpus can easily expand to hold a developing baby. A channel through the cervix allows sperm to enter and menstrual blood to exit.
<br>
•	Ovaries: The ovaries are small, oval-shaped glands that are located on either side of the uterus. The ovaries produce eggs and hormones.
<br>
•	Fallopian tubes: These are narrow tubes that are attached to the upper part of the uterus and serve as tunnels for the ova (egg cells) to travel from the ovaries to the uterus, Conception, the fertilization of an egg by a sperm, normally occurs in the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where it implants into the lining of the uterine wall.

<h1>
    So, What happens during the menstrual cycle?
    </h1> 
    The menstrual cycle is the monthly hormonal cycle a female’s body goes through to prepare for pregnancy. Your menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of your period up to the first day of your next period. Your hormone levels (estrogen and progesterone) usually change throughout the menstrual cycle and can cause menstrual symptoms. The average menstrual cycle takes about 28 days and occurs in phases: the follicular phase, the ovulatory phase (ovulation), and the luteal phase. But this time may differ from person to person depending on their diet, exercising habits etc. 
There are four major hormones (chemicals that stimulate or regulate the activity of cells or organs) involved in the menstrual cycle: follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estrogen, and progesterone.
An ovary discharges a mature egg, which travels to the uterus. In the uterus, if the egg is not fertilized, the lining in the uterine sheds away (menstruation) and a new cycle begins. The menstrual cycle is split into two stages: the follicular stage and the luteal stage. The stages are governed by hormonal changes induced by developing oocytes in the ovaries.
During the follicular phase, the endometrial lining will proliferate and thicken. During the luteal phase, the thickened endometrium will secrete factors which prepare it for implantation of a fertilised egg. If no egg is fertilised, the endometrial lining will degrade, triggering menstruation 
The ‘start’ of the menstrual cycle is defined as the first day of menstruation.

    </p >
    <p  class="menstruation">
        <h1>Menstruation</h1>
        Menstruation is a woman’s monthly bleeding, often called your “period.” When you menstruate, your body discards the monthly buildup of the lining of your uterus (womb). Menstrual blood and tissue flow from your uterus through the small opening in your cervix and pass out of your body through your vagina.
During the monthly menstrual cycle, the uterus lining builds up to prepare for pregnancy. If you do not get pregnant, estrogen and progesterone hormone levels begin falling. Very low levels of estrogen and progesterone tell your body to begin menstruation.
Having a period means someone is not pregnant, but that it may be possible for them to become pregnant in the future. This can happen any time around ovulation when the ovaries release an egg.
A person’s first period indicates that the menstrual cycle has begun. Doctors refer to this as menarche. For most females, it occurs between the ages of 9–15, with the average age being 12.4 years.
A period is one of the signs of puberty, which is the beginning of a journey toward sexual maturity. This likely means that it is possible to get pregnant.
However, a person can become pregnant from the first time they ovulate, which means it is possible to get pregnant before the first period.
